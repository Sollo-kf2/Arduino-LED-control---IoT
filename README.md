# Arduino-LED-control-IoT
This is an Arduino project that was developed for an university assignment and now is being shared for open source purposes to be used by anyone to enjoy and learn from it.

There are two files in resporitory.
1.  Arduino UNO file, which contains everything that is necessary to get the LEDs to respond to FFT values, effectively react to music that is being input through the Arduino.
2.  ESP8266 - WiFi file, containing the code that is necessary for the NodeMCU ESP to have in order to communicate with an IoT provider Blynk.io.

This project relies upon Blynk.io to communicate between an iOS application and the Arduino.



Please share and enjoy this project!
